# ClearPath Medical Marketing Insights

## The goal of this project is to investigate the performance of marketing campaigns at ClearPath Medical in order to surface recommendations on marketing budget allocation across future campaign categories

Founded in 2016, ClearPath is a U.S.-based medical insurance company serving thousands of customers. In 2019, they introduced marketing campaigns focused on wellness tips, affordability, and preventative care. Customers can choose from four plans—bronze, silver, gold, and platinum—offering varying premiums and coverage rates.

Now that they’ve hired a new data team and are strategizing their marketing budget for the year, the company would like to build more understanding of the effectiveness of these campaign categories and how they relate to signups and subsequent patient claims. The budget is allocated to drive two primary objectives: 1) to increase the number of customer signups, and 2) to raise awareness of MedCare's brand across the country.

# Dataset Structure

The dataset consisted of three tables, including information about campaigns, signups and user demographics, as well as claims filed by customers and related claim information.

# Insights Summary

In order to evaluate campaign performance, we focused on the following key metrics:
* Signup Rate: The percent of people who see a campaign and subsequently sign up for a Row Health plan.
* Cost per Signup: The average dollars spent in order to acquire a signup from each campaign.
* Click through Rate: The percent of people who see a campaign and click on the associated link.

Marketing
* Across campaign categories, Health For All and Benefit Updates achieved the highest CTRs (22%-25%), nearly 3x higher than the average CTR at 9%
* Golder Years Security stands out with a relatively high CPC at $0.68 compared to the average of $0.07. On top on that, it had the lowest CTR at 1%. This needs to be looked into as it suggests inefficent spending for the campaign
* Tailored Health Plans recorded the highest impressions (1.4M) but below-average CTR (7%), this could indicate a potential misalignment between audience targeting and messaging.
